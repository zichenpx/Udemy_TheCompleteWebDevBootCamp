# Udemy coures - The Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp

https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/

The course is taught by the lead instructor, Angela Yu, at the App Brewery, London's leading in-person programming bootcamp. This course enables me to learn more about coding which something is different from my previous work and gives me comprehensive web development knowledge, also, I am totally interested in, and prepare to become a full-stack web developer.

## 1. Motivations

What motivated me to purchase and learn this course? "Passion in web development!" Okay, okay, I know it's a clich√©. The real reasons are my passion for web development developed by javascript(backend), and I found the way the Instructor Angela tutoring was suited for me, thus I purchase this course, though it was pretty much irrelevant to my work at that time. Because it was to some degree unrelated to my work and my work was getting loaded, I took some time to finish it. I am glad I sticked to the end.
In this course, in this repo, I learned and I coded things, topics related below:

- Front-End Web Development
