# Level Challenge 1 - The Dicee Game

## What's inside?

A website paint with a h1 with a title that says Refresh Me, and then it's got Player 1 dice and Player 2 dice. 
And when we refresh our web site then our dice get thrown randomly, so that player 1 and player 2 both have their own dice values, and our web site will announce a winner depending on whose dice value was higher.
